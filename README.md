# Mlflow Demo

This is the demonstration for how to simply apply mlflow to a simple Machine Learning project. 
This also include how to combine hyperopt and mlflow to make hyperparameters tunning more efficient.

This is for the mid-term of the subject called Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education.
I got 9.0/10.0 (A+) for this presentation.
